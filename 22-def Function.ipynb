They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.\n","* functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again. \n","* Functions will be one of the most basic levels of **reusing code in Python**.\n"," * **example:**If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function <code>len()</code> to get the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.\n","\n","* There ate two Inbult keywords helps to create function in python.\n"," * <code>def</code>\n"," * <code>lambda</code>\n","\n","\n","\n"," ## <code>def</code> Statements:\n","\n"," * We begin with <code>def</code> then a space followed by the name of the function. Try to keep names relevant, for example <code>len()</code> is a good name for a <code>length()</code> function. Also be careful with names, you wouldn't want to call a function the same name as a [built-in function in Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) (such as len).\n","\n","* Next come a pair of parentheses with a number of arguments separated by a comma. These arguments are the inputs for your function. You'll be able to use these inputs in your function and reference them. After this you put a colon.\n","* **Types of Arguments**\n"," * Default Argument\n"," * Positional Argument\n"," * Keyword Argument\n","\n","* Now here is the important step, you must indent to begin the code inside your function correctly. Python makes use of *whitespace* to organize code. Lots of other programing languages do not do this, so keep that in mind.\n","\n","* Next you'll see the docstring, this is where you write a basic description of the function. Using iPython and iPython Notebooks, you'll be able to read these docstrings by pressing Shift+Tab after a function name. Docstrings are not necessary for simple functions, but it's good practice to put them in so you or other people can easily understand the code you write.\n","\n","* At last <code>return</code> allows a function to *return* a result that can then be stored as a variable, or used in whatever manner a user wants."],"metadata":{"id":"n0lmWdRteumr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["heisenberg_quote = \"It ceases to exist without me.
